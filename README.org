* Nix CI

** Setup

*** Nix expression

    To set up CI for your project, add ~default.nix~ to the root of your
    repository. It should be a Nix expression that builds your repo and optionally
    runs tests.

    For example, here's how ~default.nix~ might look like for an Autotools project:

    #+BEGIN_SRC nix
    with import <nixpkgs> {};

    stdenv.mkDerivation rec {
      name = "example";
      src = stdenv.lib.cleanSource ./.;

      nativeBuildInputs = [ autoreconfHook pkgconfig ];
      buildInputs = [ gtk3 ];

      enableParallelBuilding = true;
    }
    #+END_SRC

    If in doubt, ask operations team and we'll help you set it up.

*** GitHub webhook

    Go to https://github.com/serokell/your-project/settings/hooks and create a
    new webhook. Settings:

    - Payload URL: https://ci.serokell.io
    - Content type: application/json
    - Secret: ~joke rookie philosophy invest sweetener phantom devil~
    - Events: only enable "Pull requests"
